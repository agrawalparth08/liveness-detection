# liveness-detection
A repository to compare and contrast different methods for liveness detection and trying an ensemble method in the end to avoid L1 and L2 spoofing stated as benchmark on liveness.com

# Literature and Inspiration

## Adrian Rosenbrock's [article][1] on Liveness detection - 

The approaches he mentioned are the ones which are used today mostly for this problem statement.

1. __Texture analysis__ - Computing Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) over face regions and using an SVM to classify the faces as real or spoofed.

2. __Frequency analysis__ - Examining the Fourier domain of the face.

3. __Variable focusing analysis__- Examining the variation of pixel values between two consecutive frames.

4. __Heuristic-based algorithms__ - Eye movement, lip movement, and blink detection. These set of algorithms attempt to track eye movement and blinks to ensure the user is not holding up a photo of another person (since a photo will not blink or move its lips).

5. __Optical Flow algorithms__ - Examining the differences and properties of optical flow generated from 3D objects and 2D planes.
3D face shape, similar to what is used on Appleâ€™s iPhone face recognition system, enabling the face recognition system to distinguish between real faces and printouts/photos/images of another person.

6. __Combinations of the above__ - Enabling a face recognition system engineer to pick and choose the liveness detections models appropriate for their particular application.
