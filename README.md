# liveness-detection
A repository to compare and contrast different methods for liveness detection and trying an ensemble method in the end to avoid L1 and L2 spoofing stated as benchmark on liveness.com

# Literature and Inspiration

## Adrian Rosenbrock's [article][1] on Liveness detection - 

The approaches he mentioned are the ones which are used today mostly for this problem statement.

1. __Texture analysis__ - Computing Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) over face regions and using an SVM to classify the faces as real or spoofed.

2. __Frequency analysis__ - Examining the Fourier domain of the face.

3. __Variable focusing analysis__- Examining the variation of pixel values between two consecutive frames.

4. __Heuristic-based algorithms__ - Eye movement, lip movement, and blink detection. These set of algorithms attempt to track eye movement and blinks to ensure the user is not holding up a photo of another person (since a photo will not blink or move its lips).

5. __Optical Flow algorithms__ - Examining the differences and properties of optical flow generated from 3D objects and 2D planes.
3D face shape, similar to what is used on Appleâ€™s iPhone face recognition system, enabling the face recognition system to distinguish between real faces and printouts/photos/images of another person.

6. __Combinations of the above__ - Enabling a face recognition system engineer to pick and choose the liveness detections models appropriate for their particular application.

# Algorithms

1. __High res face masks with eyes and lips and nose cutouts__ 
    
    Color Texture Analysis [Paper][3] [Matlab Code][4]
    
2. __Deep Learning CNN Approach__ - 

    1. LivenessNet [Pyimagesearch][1] 
    
    2. Model 3 proposed in this [paper][5] and [source code][6] on CASIA-FASD Dataset.
        The dataset has some restrictions of access. Try VPN (Southeast Asia) and registering [here][7]
        
3. __Red Eye + Texture Analysis__

    This is a proposed approach which takes into consideration the hardware on which the face detection is to be run.
    
    Some references -
    
    1. [Selfie Flash][8] which gave me the idea that you don't need front flash in mobile device
        
    2. [Red Eye Effect][9] which takes away blinking plus video specific spoofing
        
    3. [Face Texture][10] found from the very interesting comparison [paper][11] for liveness detection
